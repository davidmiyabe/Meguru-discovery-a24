# Meguru-discovery-a24

The A24 travel planner is a conceptual web app that helps travelers craft cinematic journeys by exploring destinations inspired by A24 films. It provides a modern React and Vite-based interface for browsing locations, building itineraries, and uncovering hidden gems with a film enthusiast's touch.
